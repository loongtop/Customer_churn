In the project, I will share a SQL project that analyses the likelihood of a bank's customer churn based on information collected from a dataset. These insights come from personal information such as age, gender, income and demographics, bank card types, products, customer credit scores, and the length of time the customer has been with the bank. It is more beneficial for banks to understand how to retain customers than to find others.
